  <h2>What is Plume forms?</h2>
  <p>
    Plume forms is an avian-centric, declarative and reactive way to rapidly
    build forms in Angular. It's low code nature empowers you to rapidly build
    the most complex forms with without writing a whole lot of code. While being
    a rather opinionated, it was still built with flexibility in mind; after
    all, not everybody likes the Angular Material design system. Having said
    that, the built-in form components that come with the package do implement
    the Angular Material design system components, but can easily be overridden
    by extending the base class and overriding the template.

    you tired of stringing together template and typescript? Do you like birds?
